Some of my greatest friends, and most of my greatest experiences, I owe to couchsurfing.com.  My first experience surfing, came at the home of a Bogotano friend that I had hosted in my own home only a couple months before.  When I arrived at his home, where he lived with his parents, cat and dog, I was greeted (in solely Spanish of course) warmly and given all the amenitites a humble traveler could ask for.  I also arrived with less than 50 spanish words in my vocabulary, and no idea what I was supposed to do next.  Thankfully, my hosts aided me in spanish lessons, advice on the best that Colombia has to offer, and several portions the infamous Aguardiente.  In the mornings, I would have breakfast with the family, where the my friend Harold\'s mother would explain grammatical oddities of spanish, in spanish.  It was this immersion that quashed any final fears of speaking spanish, if I wanted breakfast, I asked for desayuno, when I needed to go to the embassy, I told informed family \"Tengo que ir a la embajada\!"
