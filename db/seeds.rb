The year was 2013, and I had just landed in New York City, attempting to piece together an existence studying, flipping coffee and getting myself into whatever trouble I could find. <br/><br/>  A pastime of mine in those days, was to sit on my roof with my best friend Ricardo while passing a joint and listen to his stories of adventure abroad.  We covered everything from admiring mountain ranges in Thailand, to hallucinogenic Parisian absinthe, to outsmarting police in Germany.  I suppose it was only a matter of time before I would find myself a cog in one of these journeys. <br/><br/>  The plan was to fly to Rio de Janeiro for the upcoming futbol world cup, our Earth’s united pastime, and the United State’s idea of posh men flailing for no reason.  Our plan was flawless, except for a single point of failure that we were both dead broke.  Just a flight to Rio would have costed us a month’s income, and we wouldn’t dream of cutting back on our fiscal beer and marijuana budgets.  We would not be deterred or sobered by this, as opted to begin our journey in Bogota Colombia for a much more reasonable rate, that left plenty of flexibility for Aguardiente and Agile.  After Colombia, we would backpack around the Northwestern region of South America, visiting Ecuador, Peru and a short stay in Panama.

  body: ' As any intelligent virgin traveler would, I figured it was about time to start honing my Spanish skills, 20 hours before our flight to Bogota.  My wrestling match with the Spanish language began at a taco truck in Jamaica Queens.  The dialogue went something like as follows: <br/><br/> ETHAN:  Hey Ricardo, how do you ask for a chicken taco in Spanish? <br/><br/>  RICARDO: Tell him: \'Yo quiero un taco de pollo\' <br/><br/> ETHAN: (speaking to taco man) Estoy un de taco de pollo. <br/><br/>  TACOMAN: (in english) Yeah sure man, you want red sauce or green sauce? <br/><br/> ETHAN: Verde!  I mean, green! <br/><br/>  TACOMAN: (switches to Spanish) Algo a tomar? (Translation: anything to drink?) <br/><br/> ETHAN: What, huh? <br/><br/> RICARDO: He asked you if you want anything to drink dude! <br/><br/> ETHAN: Yo quiero un Harrito! <br/><br/>  TACOMAN: (slightly more confused than annoyed) You mean a Jarrito? <br/><br/> ETHAN: Yeah that. <br/><br/> TACOMAN: Alright what kind? <br/><br/> ETHAN: Lime!  I mean, Limon.  Lo siento. <br/><br/> My expertise of the Spanish language would remain more or less at a toddler’s level for the entirety of my trip, and would lead to some hilarious and embarrassing encounters for all parties involved.  I remember asked a lot of people what time it was, in Spanish, and then checking the time for myself since I didn\'t understand a single syllable of the response.  I also remember apologizing a lot in Spanish, not sure how much that speaks to a timid character, or how out of place I was. <br/><br/> After many awkward situations and more than a few unintentional insults, I would drastically improve my Spanish to a conversational level.  The trick that finally improved my Spanish, surprisingly was actually trying to learn the language. ',

  title: 'Landing In Bogota',
  body: 'The neighborhood La Candelaria in Bogota is where the city of Bogota humbly began.  It sits in the shadow of the towering Andes mountains, and experiences frequent rain as the mountains to the East impede any clouds and dump any moisture upon the city.  La Candelaria is the old town, cobblestone streets wind and bend without much motor vehicle safety for pedestrians on either sidewalk.  Old Architecture style buildings are painted in beautiful pastel, which almost veil the steel bars over all the windows.  La Candelaria is dense with hostels, museums, restaurants and home to a couple of the most prestigious universities in Colombia, and so Candelaria is protected and a safe neighborhood for all.  The barrios, or neighborhoods surrounding La Candelaria on almost all sides are a different story entirely. <br/><br/>  We arrived late in Bogota, and took a taxi to our hostel.  I listened with intense confusion as Ricardo chatted with the taxi driver, probing for hints of the safety of Bogota, as well as the best way to find the nearest wild party.   I Took in the nighttime scenery as we drove through the city, I was impressed by the fantastic murals and graffiti, as well as taken aback by the scrappy ongoings.  It was a bit overwhelming to see stray dogs, and bums rummaging through trash. <br/><br/>  After checking into our hostel, Ricardo and I trekked a few steep blocks toward the main street running through La Candelaria.  We stopped in a small shop and restaurant, where to the delight of the owner and jeering geezers, I attempted to order some empanadas and water, in my fledgling Spanish.  The owner was more than happy to give me plenty of patience and pointers.  The old drunks chuckled only at my pronunciation, and without malice.  I’m sure it helped that we were paying double for the water, and buying stale pastries that would have been rightfully discarded.',

  body: 'Our first few expeditions in Bogota were either very positive, or a little harsh, with not much in between.  The restaurants we found were delicious, but ordering in Spanish was a bit of a fiasco, fellow travelers we met were cordial, but others were rude because we were gringos.  Our first day, we wandered the streets and shops in La Candelaria, and admired Bogota from above at Monserate. <br/><br/>  Eventually we decided to take a day trip to a village and common tourist destination outside Bogota called Zipaquira.  Zipaquira is a bit of a time capsule into a previous era of Colombia, a village best enjoyed lazily spending an afternoon, sitting in the shade of a cafe on the main plaza, watching children chase birds, or families strutting in their Sunday\'s best.  Zipaquira\'s main attraction is an cathedral carved into an underground salt mine, many years ago.  Elaborately and extravagantly lit, it is a pleasure to learn how it was constructed, or how important Catholicism is to the Colombian People.  Or at least, I assume it would be, since Ricardo and I ignorantly opted to spend our pesos and braincells on aguardiente, instead of the ten dollar entrance fee. <br/><br/> While it wasn’t my most sensible or culturally responsible moment, we didn\'t waste the whole afternoon fortunately, as we wandered around the quiet town center, eating ice cream, making friends with stray dogs, and playing in a small maze built for children.   We had lunch and took photos, while Ricardo bolstered his Spanish befriending the locals.  We found our way to the village (above ground) Cathedral and main plaza, were we spent the remainder of our short time in Zipaquira, watching children harass well-to-do animals, and merchants peddling ice cream and sweets. <br/><br/> It was in Zipaquira that we experienced our first of many miracles on this trip.  We actually found our bus back to Bogota, and boarded on time.  This is particularly miraculous, given the awful rainstorm that swamped us as we attempted to escape the village. ',

  title: 'A Ziplining Debacle and Reconciliation with God',
  body: 'A zipline mishap & reconnecting with God It\'s funny how quickly a brush with your own mortality can make you instantly reconsider your previous conclusions on the afterlife.  In Banos Ricardo and I set out into the mountains on bicycles with the couple from Guatemala and Miami.  We cruised and climbed into the amazon taking in the lush green jungle and mountains, passing 3-4 waterfalls, one that was big enough to hear from a good distance away.  We stopped for directions at one point and were deliberately told incorrect directions despite the fact that 3/4 of us were proficient in Spanish, and had neutral accents.  No matter, we arrived to the destinations we desired eventually.  Finally we reached a point at the top of a mountain range, that looked down upon a valley, and a corresponding range maybe 400-500 meters away, separated by a vast expand and a river.  Since this was Banos after all, the village where Ecuadorian travel agency\'s shoo white dreadlocked travelers who think they want to tap into their spiritual side, there is a zipline.  A zipline that threads from the larger mountain where we stood, 500 meters across an abyss, with a rushing river that seems only an drop of water running down a window from that high up, across to the other mountain.  It was never really a question of whether we would go or not, it just was.  We donned our harnesses and helmets and received our safety briefing in a language I understood 4% of.  All too soon I found myself supporting myself with my hands, secured onto the wire from my back, in a superman position.  At the time of an adventurous and dangerous event such as this, you think that you are scared, but you have no idea how petrified you are about to become when something with this contraption goes horribly wrong.  I heard the woman holding my harness in place, who would release me across mountains and into oblivion chatting rapidly into a radio to the people on the other end of the zipline, all I caught I was "Rapido!" as it started to rain slightly and the wind picked up.  The ride was monumental, screaming across the sky faster than life, the mountains passing below you like dust in the wind.  Around second 40 or 41, of a maybe 50 second trip I became dreadfully aware that my body and entire existence were going much to fast.  The casa on the other end was becoming larger than life way too rapidly.  I reached the end, and I was catapulted forward with incredible force until I was ricocheted and flung the in the direction I had come, back over the abyss of a valley.  I slowed and stopped maybe 70% of the way across the valley and due to the orientation of the harness, and superman position was forced to look all the way down to the bottom of the valley.  I saw the river a couple hundred meters below, and my intended destination limitlessly in front of me.  All my blasphemy and using the lord\'s name in vain began to weigh on me tremendously, the rain picked up even more and I was toyed back and forth on the zipline as the wind streamed through the valley and I was picked up with it.  I am not proud to admit, but I made a reconciliation with God, should the worst come to pass, and a deal if I should be set free for a while longer.  While the event was likely commonplace for the Ecuadorians who built the zipline, for me it was existential.  Starring down 250 meters while helplessly strapped into a harness unable to move or do anything other than contemplate myself and mortality.  I had no reminiscing of childhood, no flashbacks or summation of life experiences and what I would amount to.  I suppose that is evidence to the fact that I was not really that close to perishing, but at the time, I would have believed that this might be the end.  My salvation came in the more of a boy, no older than 11 years old.  He strapped himself into his own harness and pulled himself out to meet me.  He told me to hold on to his harness, which I did gratefully and he pulled me to the other side.  I survived my ziplining mishap, my reconciliation with God didn\'t last much longer than the trip back across the valley.  We hitchhiked back to town in a flatbed truck, already loaded with tired workers headed into town.',

My days in Bogota were sometimes energetic, sometimes dreary but always informative.  As the first city I would visit, I dove and stumbled headfirst into the language and culture of Colombians.  Bogota was my introduction into the lives, dance, and struggle everyday Colombians; ground zero for my nomadic travels, where I learned the fundamentals of Spanish and the only logical place to start my journey'.html_safe,

  description: 'Resilience is imperative for any drifting traveler, whether mental physical or humerous the road winds and can up end you at a moments notice.  Towards the end of my virgin expedition outside of the US and separted from my friends, I felt discouraged and found myself brooding as much as sweating poolside at a hostel.  That\'s where I met a amiable German man named Philip, who immediately lifted me back up, mentally and physically.  We wandered around a sticky downtown panama city, shielding our eyes from decadence, and lowered them from poverty.  Eventually we ventured into the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel, one of the tallest building overlooking the city.  We somehow skirted security and found our way to a floor well above our paygrade, and crept up the final 20 flights of stairs to a vacant rooftop restaurant.  We owned the roof and city, indulging in photos and jokes, taking our time to peruse all the views from the top floor.  We never were captured, much less given a questioning eye.  '.html_safe,

  body: 'Couch Surfing and the people I have met via surfing or hosting, will always have a special place in my heart.  Couchsurfing.com embodies the idea of realworld benefits only possible via an online community, on a greater scale than (in my opinion) any other website.  The community is at the same time so vast and far-flung, small and tight-knit, with diversity and common ground.  Some of my greatest friends, and most of my greatest experiences, I owe to couchsurfing.com.  My first experience surfing, came at the home of a Bogotano friend that I had hosted in my own home only a couple months before.  When I arrived at his home, where he lived with his parents, cat and dog, I was greeted (in solely Spanish of course) warmly and given all the amenitites a humble traveler could ask for.  I also arrived with less than 50 spanish words in my vocabulary, and no idea what I was supposed to do next.  Thankfully, my hosts aided me in spanish lessons, advice on the best that Colombia has to offer, and several portions the infamous Aguardiente.  In the mornings, I would have breakfast with the family, where the my friend Harold\'s mother would explain grammatical oddities of spanish, in spanish.  It was this immersion that quashed any final fears of speaking spanish, if I wanted breakfast, I asked for desayuno, when I needed to go to the embassy, I told informed family \"Tengo que ir a la embajada\!"  I am extremely thankful to my Colombian family who guided me in the first few days of my Gonzo adventure, and all the friends I have made from couchsurfing.com will always have a place to crash in my home.'.html_safe,
