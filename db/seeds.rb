A common destination for vacationers, partiers and drifters like myself, Medellin offered paradise to all.  A theory of mine, is that all the greatest cities in the world require you to climb over some garbage to get to the best parts, while this city of Paisas, like every city is not without rough sectors.  Yet almost every single trip, subway ride and party was secure and appealing.  It is unforunate that Medellin has yet again portrayed as a home of the narcos, when in reality, this city is an exemplary example of innovation in the wake of disaster.  Not only has this city become safe for citizens and travelers, it is clean, friendly and damn good fun if you can dance a little.  Without a question, Paisas, (the inhabitants of Medellin) are the friendliest people I've come across in all my travels.  In Christmas this wonderland takes on a purple tint, and the entire city lights up as every home dons lights.  Built in the bottom of a valley, every view is spectacular, the city runs up from the river into the walls of the valley that is not to be missed.".html_safe,
